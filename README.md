# Ides

A simple calendar app, in order for me to gain familiarity with a few technologies in an unfamiliar stack:

- Python Flask as the backend.
- GraphQL API.
- Vue.js for the frontend.
- Bootstrap CSS for styling.

I'm aware of the advice about not doing too many things at once, but, well, I've always enjoyed drinking from a firehose.
